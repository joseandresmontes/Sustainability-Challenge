Kellogg Morgan Stanley 2020 Sustainability Challenge

Every year, the Kellogg-Morgan Stanley Sustainable Investing Challenge invites teams of graduate students from around the world to develop and pitch creative financial approaches to tackle pressing social and environmental challenges.
 
In 2019, more than 365 students from over 50 countries and 80 schools proposed novel financial instruments to create positive impact. 
 
The Challenge identifies, empowers, and inspires the next generation of sustainable finance practitioners and connects them with leading industry professionals.

This year, I formed a team with fellow graduate classmates from two different universities to tackle the challenge of plastic waste. Combining our expertise and skills, we will be developing a creative financial approach that seeks to change how indonesia manages its plastic waste.
